1. Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}. What is

    a) 4 + 4

    4 + 4  ≡ 1 mod 7

    b) 3 x 5

    3 x 5  ≡ 1 mod 7

    c) what is the inverse of 3?

    From Fermat's little theorem

    $a^{-1} \equiv a^{p-2} \mod p$,

    $3^{-1} \equiv 3^5 \mod 7 \equiv 243 \mod 7 \equiv 5 \mod 7$

    Answer: 5 is the inverse of 3.

2. For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}

    Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group?

    Yes, when we take addition mod 7.

3. What is -13 mod 5?

    -13 mod 5 = 2

4. Polynomials

    For the polynomial $x^3 - x^2 + 4x - 12$

    Find the positive root?

    What is the degree of this polynomial?

    Degree of polynomial is 3.

    2 is a root: $2^3 - 2^2 + 4 \cdot 2 - 12 = 8 - 4 + 8 - 12 = 0$

    $x^3 - x^2 + 4x - 12 = (x-2)(x^2 + x + 6)$
